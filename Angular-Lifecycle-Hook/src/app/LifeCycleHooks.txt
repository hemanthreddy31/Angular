The angular life cycle hooks are methods that angular invokes on a directive or a component, as it creates, changes and destroys them


--Component Created

ngOnChanges
ngOnInit
ngDoCheck
ngAfterContentInit
ngAfterContentChecked
ngAfterViewInit
ngAfterViewChecked
ngDestroy

--ComponentCreated

** angular raises ngOnInit hook after it creates the component and update its input properties. 
   this hook is raised after ngOnChanges


** The ngOnInit hook is fired only once i.e during the first change detection cycle. After that, if 
    the input property changes , this hook does not gets called.


**By the time ngOninit gets called, none of the child components or projected contents or view are available at this point 
Hence any property decorated with @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild or @ContentChildren will not be available to use.
